# Data Mining Project

## Overview

This project involves data analysis, classification, and regression using Python. The notebooks contain exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, and visualization techniques to extract meaningful insights from the dataset.

## Features

- Data loading and preprocessing
- Statistical analysis
- Data visualization with Seaborn and Matplotlib
- Classification and regression models
- Identifying patterns and trends in the dataset

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. Load the provided notebooks (`dataminig_P.ipynb` and `Data mining 2.ipynb`).

3. Run the cells sequentially to perform data analysis, classification, and regression.

## Project Structure

- `dataminig_P.ipynb`: Contains data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and regression models.
- `Data mining 2.ipynb`: ContainsÂ data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis with classification models.
